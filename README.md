## Open source Monitoring and Observability Stack on Kubernetes
Kubernetes is the go-to for container management, giving organizations superpowers for running container applications at scale.  Kubernetes can simplify the management of your containerized applications and services across different cloud services. It can be a double-edged sword, though, as it also adds complexity to your system by introducing a lot of new layers and abstractions, which translates to more components and services that need to be monitored. This makes Kubernetes monitoring and overall observability even more critical. <br>
Aim of this project is to put together an open source monitoring and observability stack on kubernetes covering Monitoring, Alerting/Visualization, Log Aggregation/analytics, and Distributed systems tracing infrastructure which collectively make up observability.
